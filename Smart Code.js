The tool should include a feature where developers can highlight and explain differences in code. This is useful for debugging and learning.

Implementation Using Diff Libraries

Using jsdiff, we can compare two code snippets:

const diff = require('diff');

let code1 = "function hello() { return 'Hello World'; }";

let code2 = "function hello() { return 'Hello, World!'; }";

let changes = diff.diffWords(code1, code2);

changes.forEach(part => {

  let color = part.added ? 'green' : part.removed ? 'red' : 'grey';

  console.log(`%c${part.value}`, `color:${color}`);
});
