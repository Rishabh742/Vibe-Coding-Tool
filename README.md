Introduction
The Wipecoding Tool is a web application designed to enhance the coding experience by fostering a positive, creative, and engaging environment. It incorporates features that make coding feel effortless and enjoyable, focusing on clean UI, smooth development flow, and seamless integration of external tools. The project is built using React (Next.js), Framer Motion, Spotify Web Playback API, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

Project Features & Explanation
1. Basic Drawing Tool (Sketchpad)
   Purpose:
  The drawing tool allows developers to quickly sketch ideas, design UI layouts, or visualize logic flows before writing code.

Implementation Details:
 (1) Utilizes the HTML5 Canvas API for drawing.
 (2) Captures user interactions (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup) to create a freehand sketch.
 (3) Provides a 500x300 pixel canvas with a simple border for clean visuals.
 (4) Uses React state (useState) to track drawing activity.
 (5) Stores the canvas context (useRef) to manage drawing operations.

How It Works:
 (1) When the user presses the mouse, a new path begins.
 (2) As the mouse moves, lines are drawn to create the sketch.
 (3) When the mouse is released, the path is closed, and drawing stops.

2. Spotify Integration for Mood-Based Coding
   Purpose:
 Music enhances focus and productivity. This feature allows users to set their coding mood by playing music from Spotify.

Implementation Details:
 (1) Accepts Spotify Track URI as input.
 (2) Integrates Spotify Web Playback API to stream music.
 (3) Uses a React input field for entering track URIs.
 (4) Embeds a Spotify player component that plays the selected track.
 (5) Requires a Spotify authentication token to function.

How It Works:
 (1) The user enters a track URI into the input box.
 (2) If a valid URI is provided, the Spotify Web Player starts streaming the song.
 (3) Users can change the song by entering a different URI.

3. UI Component Library
   Purpose:
 To accelerate the development process, this feature offers pre-built UI components that can be easily copied and reused.

Implementation Details:
 (1) Includes pre-styled buttons (primary & outline).
 (2) Uses Tailwind CSS for styling.
 (3) Components are enclosed in a Card UI for a professional look.
 (4) Can be extended to include more UI elements such as forms, modals, and navigation bars.

How It Works:
 (1) Users can preview different UI components.
 (2) They can copy the component code and use it in their own projects.
 (3) The library can be expanded with more UI elements.

4. Smart Code Explanation
   Purpose:
 Helps developers understand complex code snippets by providing real-time explanations.

Implementation:
 (1) Users will paste code snippets into a text area.
 (2) The tool will analyze the code and provide line-by-line explanations.
 (3) Uses AI-driven natural language processing (NLP) to generate explanations.
 (4) Might integrate with ChatGPT API or Code Analysis Libraries.

 Future Enhancements:
 (1) Auto-generate comments for code snippets.
 (2) Offer syntax highlighting for better readability.
 (3) Provide alternative, optimized code suggestions.

How the Project Enhances the Coding Process
 (1) Boosts Creativity – Sketchpad helps developers visualize their ideas.
 (2) Improves Focus – Spotify integration sets the right coding mood.
 (3) Saves Time – Pre-built UI components speed up development.
 (4) Enhances Understanding – Smart code explanations clarify complex logic.
